# CRTER

CRTER is a command-line tool for fetching subdomains using the CRT.SH certificate search engine. It allows you to provide a list of domain names or fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) and retrieve the associated subdomains. The tool fetches the subdomains from CRT.SH and saves them to an output file.
